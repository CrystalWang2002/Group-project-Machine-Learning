### Use sentiment variable to predict unplotment rate
 This paper proposes a novel unemployment rate forecasting model that integrates 
 news sentiment variables with traditional macroeconomic indicators, enhancing its an
alytical dimension. 

Advanced machine learning techniques like Lasso, random forest, bagging are employed to effectively
 process and analyze data. This integration improves forecast accuracy and enhances
 the model’s resilience to economic fluctuations, resulting in a more robust and practical
 predictive framework.
